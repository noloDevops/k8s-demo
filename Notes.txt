This is a collection of notes from watching the tutorial. 

There is a lot to this k8s thing but I think this a good start

I need to put together the documentation to go with this repo
   - Only take it public once I am documentation
   - double check licensing and if we might have to do one ourselves 
   - Take notes from comments in the file 
   - Use links for references 
   - Reference follow and tag Nana
   - Think about packaging the public publishing as a repository
    
When you're done writing all that pretty deployment code, you need to deploy to start pods and stuff
  - deploy an application's dependencies before the application(it needs them alive)
  - config -> secret -> mongo -> web-app
  cmd: kubectl apply -f {yaml file}
